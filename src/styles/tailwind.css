/* 
  Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
  
  IMPORTANT: Bootstrap CSS is imported BEFORE this file in layout.tsx
  This ensures Bootstrap's base styles are preserved while allowing
  Tailwind utility classes to be used throughout the project.
  
  Bootstrap components and base styles will work as before.
  Tailwind utilities (like flex, grid, p-4, text-center, etc.) can be used alongside Bootstrap.
